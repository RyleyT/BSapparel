# Group8

The goal of this project is to build an online clothing store that will offer a variety of clothing apparel including T-shirts, jeans, hats, sweaters, shoes and other articles of clothing. 
Users will be able to create an account and login to our website and be able to either search for products on the site or browse different categories of items and have the items displayed back to them in various different formats. 
Items can then be added to a shopping cart which will then total up and display the price of the various items back to the user.
Other features (such as payment) will be added in time once other core features are developed first.

To run this application:
open the project folder in terminal and use "npm install" to get the dependencies.
use "npm start" to make the server go live.
then go to localhost:3000 in your preferred browser.
